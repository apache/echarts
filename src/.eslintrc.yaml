# Note:
# If eslint does not work in VSCode, please check:
# (1) Whether "@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin" and "@typescript-eslint/parser"
# are npm installed locally. Should better in the same version.
# (2) Whether "VSCode ESlint extension" is installed.
# (3) If the project folder is not the root folder of your working space, please
# config the "VSCode ESlint extension" in "settings":
# ```json
# "eslint.workingDirectories": [{"mode": "auto"}]
# ```
# Note that it should be "workingDirectories" rather than "WorkingDirectories".
